# Feature Specification: Logic Grid Puzzle — MVP

**Feature Branch**: `001-logic-grid-mvp`  
**Created**: 2025-10-20  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create an application that serves as a modern, web-based Logic Grid Puzzle Solver, transforming classic logic grid puzzles into an interactive digital experience where users deduce relationships between multiple categories from given clues. MVP must run locally, persist to the local filesystem, provide an interactive grid with marking and symmetry propagation, and save/load puzzle state."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Open & Annotate Puzzle (Priority: P1)

As a puzzle player, I want to load a puzzle file from disk, open it in an interactive grid, and mark a cell as "confirmed" or "eliminated" so I can work through the puzzle digitally.

Why this priority: This is the core user value for the MVP — interacting with a digital logic grid and making progress on a puzzle is the minimum viable experience.

Independent Test: Load the provided sample puzzle file, open the grid, mark a cell as confirmed and verify that any symmetric or propagated changes occur automatically, then save and reload the state to confirm persistence.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. Given a valid puzzle file on disk, When the user selects it to open, Then the puzzle grid and clue view display and the puzzle state is initialized.
2. Given an open puzzle, When the user marks a cell as "confirmed", Then any symmetric counterparts or deducible cells are automatically updated (e.g., corresponding row/column eliminations) and the change is reflected in the UI within 2 seconds.
3. Given modifications to the puzzle, When the user saves state, Then the state is written to disk and can be reloaded to the same annotated state.

### User Story 2 - Create / Import Puzzle (Priority: P2)

As a puzzle author or player, I want to create a new puzzle or import a puzzle file so I can begin solving or share puzzles with others locally.

Why this priority: Allows users to add content and demonstrates the app's ability to accept external puzzle definitions for the MVP.

Independent Test: Use the import flow to load a provided sample puzzle file (specified format), verify that puzzle metadata, categories, options and clues import correctly, and that the grid reflects the imported structure.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. Given a properly formatted puzzle file, When the user imports it, Then the puzzle metadata, categories, options and clues are available and the grid dimensions match the puzzle definition.

### User Story 3 - Basic Constraint Enforcement & Undo (Priority: P3)

As a solver, I want the system to prevent obvious inconsistent markings (e.g., confirming two conflicting options for the same item) and be able to undo my last action so mistakes are reversible.

Why this priority: Protects puzzle integrity and improves user experience; undo is a low-cost safety feature for users experimenting while solving.

Independent Test: Try to mark two conflicting cells as "confirmed" and verify the system rejects or warns and prevents the invalid state. Perform an action and use undo to revert to the prior state.

Acceptance Scenarios:

1. Given an open puzzle, When the user attempts an action that would create an obvious conflict (per uniqueness constraints), Then the system blocks the action or displays a clear warning and does not persist the invalid state.
2. Given recent actions, When the user selects "undo", Then the last marking is reverted and the grid reflects the prior state.

---

### Edge Cases

- Importing a malformed or unsupported puzzle file: the system should validate input and present a clear error message that explains what is wrong.
- Conflicting clues or contradictions in a puzzle definition: the system should detect immediately conflicting constraints during import and mark the puzzle as "inconsistent", showing affected clues/cells.
- Very large puzzles (many categories/options): UI should remain usable; for the MVP, document a recommended practical limit (e.g., up to 8 categories with up to 8 options each).
- Interrupted save (disk full/permission): surface a clear error and preserve in-memory state so the user can retry.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow a user to open/import a puzzle file from the local filesystem and render the puzzle grid and clues.  
  Acceptance: Given a sample puzzle file, the UI displays categories, options and a grid with the correct dimensions.

- **FR-002**: The system MUST allow a user to mark a grid cell as one of: Confirmed, Eliminated, or Unknown.  
  Acceptance: User action changes the cell state and the UI reflects the new state.

- **FR-003**: The system MUST enforce basic uniqueness constraints and symmetry propagation for markings (e.g., confirming an option eliminates conflicting options in the same row/column).  
  Acceptance: After a user confirms a cell, symmetric/eliminated cells update automatically according to puzzle constraints.

- **FR-004**: The system MUST prevent or clearly surface attempts to create an obviously inconsistent state (e.g., confirming two mutually exclusive options).  
  Acceptance: Conflicting actions are blocked and a clear message is shown; the state before the action remains unchanged.

- **FR-005**: The system MUST persist puzzle state (including user annotations) to the local filesystem and be able to reload it.  
  Acceptance: After saving, reloading the puzzle restores the annotated state exactly.

- **FR-006**: The logic/constraint engine MUST be implemented as a modular component separable from the UI so it can be reused.  
  Acceptance: Core logic lives behind a clean interface (inputs: puzzle definition, current markings; outputs: propagated markings, validity checks) and can be exercised by unit tests independent of the UI.

- **FR-007**: The system SHOULD provide a simple undo for the last user action.  
  Acceptance: Undo reverts the last marking and any propagated changes.

- **FR-008**: The system SHOULD validate puzzle input and report import-time errors (format, missing fields, or contradictions).  
  Acceptance: Import of a malformed puzzle returns a human-readable error and no partially-imported state remains.

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Puzzle**: Represents a single logic puzzle. Attributes: title, author (optional), metadata (source, date), categories (ordered list). No implementation detail about storage format in this spec.
- **Category**: A named set of options (e.g., "Person", "Drink"). Attributes: name, options.
- **Option**: A named selectable value inside a category (e.g., "Alice", "Coffee").
- **Clue**: A textual constraint describing relationships between options; used by the logic engine to infer constraints.
- **GridCell**: Represents the relation between two options (confirmed, eliminated, unknown). Attributes: coordinates (categoryA, optionA, categoryB, optionB), state.
- **PuzzleState**: Current annotations and derived state (cells, history for undo, metadata about inconsistencies).

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A developer following the README can run the app locally and load the provided sample puzzle within 10 minutes on a typical laptop (macOS/Linux/Windows).  
  Verification: Fresh checkout + steps in README produce a running app and an importable sample puzzle.

- **SC-002**: Users can open a puzzle, mark a cell, and see automatic propagation or symmetric updates within 2 seconds on a developer laptop.  
  Verification: Time measured from action to UI update ≤ 2s in normal conditions.

- **SC-003**: Persistence round-trip for puzzle state works: save -> close -> reload restores the same annotated state in 100% of tested cases for provided sample puzzles.  
  Verification: Save state, restart app, reload puzzle, and compare cell states.

- **SC-004**: The logic engine is modular and can be exercised via unit tests independent from the UI (unit tests pass for core propagation and conflict detection).  
  Verification: Run the core logic unit tests included with the repo; tests demonstrate propagation and conflict detection.

- **SC-005**: The system prevents obvious conflicting markings in interactive use (0 silent inconsistencies for the P1 user flow).  
  Verification: Attempted conflicting actions are blocked and reported.

## Assumptions

- The MVP will run locally and is intended for a single user on a developer's machine; no multi-user concurrency or remote sync is required for MVP.
- Puzzle and state files are stored on the local filesystem (recommended format documented separately). For MVP, a simple JSON file format is acceptable and documented in the README; the spec avoids mandating a storage technology.
- Authentication, cloud sync, and sharing are out of scope for MVP and documented as future work.
- Reasonable UI limits: target practical puzzles up to 8 categories with up to 8 options each for comfortable display; larger puzzles may be slower but should not break the app.

## Future Work (non-mandatory)

- Automatic solver and hint generator (algorithmic solver) as an optional, separately developed module.
- Sharing and cloud sync of puzzles and collaborative solving.
- Import/export adapters for common puzzle formats and puzzle marketplaces.

## Notes for Development

- Keep the logic/constraint engine behind a small, well-documented interface: inputs (puzzle definition + current markings), operations (applyMarking, undo, validate, propagate), outputs (new markings, conflict report). The spec intentionally doesn't prescribe how this is implemented.
