## Core Philosophy

We embrace a test-first mindset, delivering value through small, iterative changes. Our work is guided by defendable simplicity - we build what we need, when we need it (YAGNI), and continuously refine our approach based on empirical feedback. Every feature must demonstrate clear value and maintain high quality standards while avoiding unnecessary complexity.

## Core Principles

### I. Test-First Development
All new features and changes must follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles:
1. Write tests first - document expected behavior before implementation
2. Follow Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly
3. Prioritize test types:
   - Contract/Integration tests for service boundaries
   - End-to-End (E2E) tests for critical user journeys
   - Unit tests for complex business logic
4. Document any use of mocks/emulators with justification when real dependencies aren't feasible
5. Include test coverage reports with all changes

### II. Branch & Review Protocol
1. Never push directly to main branch
2. Use short-lived feature branches with clear prefixes:
   - feature/ for new functionality
   - fix/ for bug fixes
   - chore/ for maintenance tasks
   - docs/ for documentation updates
3. One logical change per branch
4. Required PR checklist:
   - Tests written and passing
   - Documentation updated
   - Run instructions verified
   - Constitutional compliance confirmed
5. At least one reviewer required for all changes

### III. Quality Standards
1. Automated quality checks:
   - Use pre-commit hooks where available
   - Enable linting appropriate to the language
   - Implement type checking when supported
2. Document fallback procedures when automated tools aren't available
3. Goals (not rigid numbers):
   - Maintain test coverage aligned with risk
   - Keep cyclomatic complexity reasonable
   - Address technical debt proactively

### IV. Code Simplicity
1. Implement smallest possible change to meet requirements
2. Prioritize readability over clever solutions
3. Remove all temporary/debug code before merge
4. Avoid premature abstraction
5. Document and justify any complexity

### V. Observability & Versioning
1. Logging requirements:
   - Use structured logging
   - Include correlation IDs
   - Log meaningful state transitions
2. Version control:
   - Follow semantic versioning
   - Document all breaking changes
   - Maintain changelog
3. If centralized tooling unavailable:
   - Document local alternatives
   - Provide setup instructions

## Governance & Exceptions

### Amendment Process
1. Propose changes via PR
2. Require team review and consensus
3. Document rationale and impact
4. Update version number according to:
   - MAJOR: Breaking changes to principles
   - MINOR: New principles or expanded guidance
   - PATCH: Clarifications and refinements

### Exception Handling
All deviations from these principles must be:
1. Documented in PR or issue
2. Include clear justification ("why needed")
3. List simpler alternatives considered
4. Provide timeline for remediation if temporary
5. Approved by at least two team members

### Compliance Review
1. Regular constitution review in retrospectives
2. Track exceptions and patterns
3. Update principles based on team feedback
4. Maintain living documentation of precedents
